# Solidity Smart Contract Using Ethereum Blockchain, JavaScript VM, MetaMask

## Joint Savings Account
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the Javascript VM
3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract

## Instructions
